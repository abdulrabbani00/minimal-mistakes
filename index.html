<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I am going to slow down on my business endeavors. I want to focus on my job and my family. I will still work on my business ideas, but I will not be as active as I have been in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Crypto is having a moment in the mainstream, and I’m very happy about it. It’s been tough in the trenches over the last few years. If you’re looking to learn more, check out my <a href="categories/cryptocurrency_and_the_blockchain/crypto-starter-guide">starter guide</a>. It’s a bit dated but has some interesting resources.</p></li>

<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>College wrestling just started, and I am really excited for another season.</p></li>
