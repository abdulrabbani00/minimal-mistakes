<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been building a social platform called <a href="https://civikka.com">Civikka</a>. I want to make a difference in the way our democracy works, here’s my first try.</li>
<li>Frontend development isn’t all that bad, I really enjoy using Sveltekit, it’s changed FE development for me.</li>
<li>I’ve been using Obsidian for journaling and personal life tracking, I can’t recommend it enough.</li>

</ul>
<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I just got back from three weeks in Spain. It was wonderful, I went to Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, and Sevilla. Europe is old. The lifestyle and value system is very different, although its too lax for me, I respect it.</li>
<li>For those of you who don’t know, I got married to my high school sweet heart in February.</li>
</ul>
