# Introduction

My name is Abdul Rabbani. I am a self-educated computer scientist. Most of my knowledge has been acquired from real-world experience, books, and online resources. Because I didn’t learn technology in a classroom, I have an advantage. While classroom instruction is limited to sometimes outdated topics, I have spent my time learning practical, real-world technology from experts in the field. My experience and fields of expertise range from low-level applications and operating systems to designing, creating and scaling cloud infrastructure in an automated fashion.

Besides technology, I have a deep love for math and science. I hope to continue to grow and expand my knowledge in both fields. I also hope to grow in fields that are outside my comfort zone. As someone who grew up in love with numbers, data, and analytics, I often neglected my creative side. I will strive to become more in touch with this side by drawing, reading, writing, and dabbling in poetry.

# Purpose of This Site

The main purpose of this website is for me to consolidate and keep track of my work. As I continue to learn, grow, and express myself over the years, I can easily go back and re-learn something that I wrote about years earlier. In addition, I strongly believe that writing about what you learn helps cement your knowledge and understanding. Overall, through this website, I want to capture my growth as an engineer, as a scientist, and most of all, as a person.

Finally, I created this website as a means of collaborating with people who share my interests and curiosity. If you see a topic that intrigues you, feel free to comment about things you like, dislike, agree with, disagree with, or want further explanation on. My email is linked here: [abdulrabbani00@gmail.com](mailto:abdulrabbani00@gmail.com). If you would like to connect, feel free to reach out.

## Types of Posts

You’ll notice various _types_ of posts as you go along. I will do my best to capture the _type_ of post as a tag. Let me give you an example: My favorite branch of Mathematics is Calculus.

- **Personal**: I could write an article on the importance of Calculus to me and the influence it has had in my life. This type of post would be a **Personal** post, where I am writing about an aspect of my life.

- **Opinionated**: I could also write a post on how I believe all high schools should offer Calculus classes. This type of post would be an **Opinionated** post, where I am sharing an idea, or something that I believe.

- **Factual**: I could also write a post explaining the _Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus_. This type of post would be a **Factual** post, where I am explaining something (correctly I hope).

- **Discovery**: I may also write about a brand new finding I might have in Calculus. This type of post would be a **Discovery** post, where I explain my scientific discovery in thorough detail.

- **Notes**: I may be learning about a new topic within Calculus, and I might create a post with explanations, questions, and other notes I have about the topic. This type of post would be a **Notes** post (I know, very creative). This will more than likely be the most common type of post on this site.

# Technical Experience

As someone who has had various roles in different organizations, I have amassed experience and expertise in many topics. [I have experience in many topics](/categories/career/technical_experience), from creating and scaling large infrastructure in an automated fashion to analyzing latency and performance for low-latency trading applications. I have a broad range of knowledge, which provides me with a unique perspective in the technical field.

## Currently

I am looking to find my next opportunity, and I am very excited. Now that I have spent a few years in the technical space, working in different roles, I have gotten a taste of what I like, and more importantly, what I don’t like. In addition, I have a better understanding of what is out there, which is important, considering how expansive and convoluted tech is. When I first started, I didn't know what I didn’t know, now I know what I know, and I know what I don't know (you might want to read that twice).

I have taken time in the last few months to grow in the technical areas that interest me the most. This includes kernel development, network programming, C, and other low-level tools and concepts. Unlike in college where you are learning the broad strokes of tech, or on the job, where you learn what you’re exposed to, I want to take the time to learn what **interests me**. Finally, I also plan on reading, writing, drawing, and growing in other fields that are non-technical.
