# Looking For a New Job?

Are you currently interviewing with tech companies to find your next venture and having
trouble finding employment? Are you finding that interviewing is far more difficult now with everything being remote? If this sounds like you, you can improve your chances of securing your dream job by becoming a better, more skilled interviewee. I, [Abdul Rabbani](/about), have had the pleasure of working at reputable companies such as Microsoft, and I have had the responsibility of interviewing potential candidates. I know what it takes to rise to the top of the candidate pool, and I want to share it with you.

Many people are finding that the job market is saturated with many great candidates, which makes the marketplace so much more competitive. In this competitive industry, small things like making a connection with a potential employer are crucial. This is why you need to find ways to stand out and show your strengths to interviewers while avoiding any red flags.

# A Note for College Grads

As someone who has interviewed many college graduates, I have come to notice that many colleges are not successfully preparing their graduates for careers in technology. Technology grows and evolves rapidly. College curriculums, on the other hand, do not. Colleges are not including technologies being used in the workplace as part of their curriculum, which is negatively affecting their students. That is why, unfortunately, I have had to turn many college graduates down for a career at Microsoft.
