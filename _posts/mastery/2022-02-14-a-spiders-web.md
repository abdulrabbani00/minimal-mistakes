# A Sense of Feel

When a spider builds its web, it doesn’t start with a blueprint or create a mapping when it’s complete. The spider follows a sense of feel; it knows what the web should be and feel like; the blueprint is within it. When the web is complete, the spider doesn’t consider it an external entity; the web is a part of them. The web is an extension of the spider.

When something happens on the web, the spider can feel the action. It doesn’t need to look at the event to know what happened; it can feel every detail. A spider doesn’t need to interpret the event externally using sight, sound, or vision. It can feel every single movement. Their sense of feel triumphs over their external queues.

## From Within

The spider’s sense of feel for the events on their web arises from within. The web is a part of them; they feel a pray landing on their web the way a human might feel a drop of water on their hand. The same way a human might wipe the water, a spider knows exactly how to react. A spider doesn’t need to stop and consider what it will do next. Their reaction and thought processes are baked into them.

A spider is a _Master_ of its web, a master of its realm. A spider interprets the events that occurred and their reactions to them internally. They feel everything that arises in their domain internally as if it’s a part of their being. A spider doesn’t stop to consider what happened or what it will do; they feel every movement and react accordingly.

# Be a Spider

We should know our domain the same way a spider knows its web. We should know it from within. Our domains should be a part of us; we should have an internal sense of feel for the events transpiring within it. If an event arises, we should have a sense of intuition for responding to it. We should hope to feel our realm the way a spider feels its web, the way we feel our hands.
