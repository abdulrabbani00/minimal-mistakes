# My Journey

I remember being in a place in my life where I didn’t know what I was going to do next. I know I wanted more than I currently had, but I didn’t know what that was or how to get there. Luckily for me, my cousin Zeeshan shined a light and introduced me to the big bad field of “tech.”

I was nervous when he started to talk to me about it. The last thing I wanted to do was waste my time learning something that I wouldn’t make a career out of. Or worse, I would be able to make a career out of it, but I wouldn’t like it, and I’d be stuck in a dead-end job. But at that moment in my life, I knew I needed a change, so I decided to take a leap of faith, and the rest was history.

# The Help I Received

Zeeshan didn’t just give me an intro to tech; he helped me out along the way. He was there for me from day one until I landed my first job, and he’s been a light in my life ever since then. A few actions that he took that helped me tremendously were:

1.  He devised a lesson plan for me to follow. I needed exposure to many fundamental concepts and ideas; the lesson plan ensured I acquired that knowledge.

2.  Once I got the fundamentals under my belt, he gave me a list of projects to complete. He helped me when I was stuck and reviewed the projects once they were complete.

3.  After a few projects under my belt, we started preparing for interviews. Zeeshan gave me all his interview prep material, including hundreds of interview questions he drafted up.

4.  After I was interview-ready, he helped me draft my resume and gave me tips on applying for jobs.

Without Zeeshan’s help, I couldn’t imagine how difficult it might have been to get started in tech. He was there every step of the way to guide me, and he helped jumpstart my career.

# Helping Others

Over the last few years, I have tried my best to help out the people in my network to find their way into tech. I’ve seen some success, and it has been gratifying.
