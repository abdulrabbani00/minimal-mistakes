# Overview

- Ex-differentiation is a very new concept but its critical

- The epigenome is the regulator of the genome.

  - Genome is four letters.

  - Epigenome reads the genome.

  - Over time our genome gets harder to read, so our cells take up the wrong roles.

# Brain Age

- The brain ages significantly slower than the rest of the body.

- There is little neurogenesis in your life; the cells you have in your brain will be there your whole life.

- Therefore the brain does an excellent job at protecting itself through these adversity mimetics. But we can make that protection even more substantial.

- Evolutionarily speaking, people never lived this long; therefore, our brains never needed to stay that sharp.

- Older people are less likely to want to learn new things.

- As we get older, we need to learn new things continuously.

## Longevity Pathway

- mTor - Respond to low amounts of amino acids

  - Responds to fasting and insulin signaling. It will recycle old proteins into new proteins (autophagy).

    - mTOR needs to be down-regulated for this to occur.

- AMPK - Senses low glucose and energy, it boosts NAD

- Sirtuins - Requires NAD to protect the cells.

  - Respond to many adversity mimetics.

  - Cert-1 and cert-6 go down as we age. Cert-1 is very important when it comes to aging.

  - We want to upregulate cert-1’s and sirtuins

- All these pathways protect the body through these adversity mimetics.

- NAD boosters create more sirtuins.

# Diet and Exercise

- Mediterranean diet can protect you from aging and reverse aging.

  - 10% reduced risk in dementia.

- Resveratrol activates cert-1

- Olive oil can activate cert-1

- Vitamin B-12 is crucial, and people on a plant-based diet might not get enough.

  - Adds methyls in your DNA

- High homocysteine indicates how healthy you are.

  - It is correlated to dementia.

- No alcohol or smoking (mos pi duhan)

- Fatty Acids

  - We need to make sure we get enough fatty acids.

  - Fish is a great resource.

  - EPA/DHA ratio is critical.

  - Linoleic acid - Flaxseed, walnuts

  - Oleic Acids - Olive oils and avocado

  - Omega-3

    - It might be useful to get 1 gram a day

    - These fats are great for our brain. It protects the brain and helps restore it.

- You need exercise

  - Better blood flow

  - Better neural activity

  - Sirtuins are activated through exercise

  - Increases executive function

# Supplementation

## Metformin - AGAIN

- Metformin can turn NMN into NAD.

- Treating fish with metformin can improve their memory.

- Metformin can cause higher cell activity and suck sugar out of your blood.

- Metformin helped reverse mild cases of dementia.

- Metformin helped prevent dementia by 55%

## NAD Boosters

- NAD levels go down in the brain as we age.

- Sarm1 depletes cells of NAD; we create more sarm1 as we age.

- NAD-H is NAD with hydrogen attached.

  - NAD is also a hydrogen carrier for cells.

  - You don’t want too much NAD-H.

- B3 → NR + Phosphate→ NMN → NAD

# Increasing Blood Flow

- Vascular blood flow is incredibly important for our brain.

- NMN and cert-1 help create new blood vessels.

- Upregulating cert-1 protects mice for many diseases.

# Sleep

- Sleep is essential to tell your body when to activate and relax.

- We get worse at sleep as we get older; insufficient sleep makes us age.

- NMN can help raise NAD levels in the morning.

- Get some sunlight early in the morning.

- One night of sleep deprivation can mess you up.

# Overall Message

- We need to keep our brains healthy actively.

- We have a responsibility to our families to keep our brains healthy for our lifespan.
