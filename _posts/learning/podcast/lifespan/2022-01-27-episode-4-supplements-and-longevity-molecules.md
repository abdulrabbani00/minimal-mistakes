# Longevity Molecules

- mTOR, AMPK, Sirtuins -

  - They talk to each other, and some supplements work on multiple pathways.

  - These are the “survival pathways”.

# NAD Boosters

- Our cells use NAD to transfer hydrogen atoms between proteins and even DNA.

  - Needed to be alive.

- NAD is very abundant

- NAD helps us make energy.

- NAD’s activates the sirtuins (defensive enzymes)

- As we get older, we create less NAD.

- Fasting and exercise increase NAD levels. But as you age, you will create less NDA.

## Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)

- Vitamin b3 + Sugar

- NR is OTC since 2014.

- Many human studies show little to no side effects.

- 250 mg - 1g

- Yeast with NR lived 30% longer.

- NR → Gut → Blood Stream → Taken into muscles, cells, tissues via ENTs → Converted into NMN by NRKs → Add phosphate → 2 NMN put together create NAD.

- NR given to old mice extends lifespan by 9%.

  - More mitochondria

  - More athleticism, less inflammation.

- It needs phosphate for NR to turn into NAD.

- Studies show that it increases NAD levels after 9-10 days

  - Lower blood sugar, less inflammation.

  - Not many long-term effects have been studied.

## Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)

- The closer you get to NAD, the easier it will be to create NAD.

- Many labs show NMN works better at the same dose (unsure why).

- Specific transporter (SLC12aa) _might_ explain how NMN gets into cells.

- Not sure why NMN works, but it's clear that it does work.

- Mice live longer by 10-15% with NMN.

  - Works better in female mice.

  - Preliminary study

  - Hard to see a full lifespan study cause mice live 2-3 years.

- NR and NMN have similar effects, but NMN is more effective.

- NMN has not shown any negative side effects.

- Not many human studies on NMN.

- 250mg - 1g dosage.

## NAD Directly?

- NAD Drips

  - People in Florida have been doing drips under medical supervision.

  - No actual studies don't on NAD drips.

  - It has been used to treat addiction, hangovers, and depression.

- Giving yeast NAD directly didn't work; it's too big.

  - The smaller the molecule, the easier it is for the cell to pick it up.

## Best Way to Consume

- The best way to take it is to ingest it (pills or powder).

  - No research shows that one is better than the other.

## NAD Booster and Cancer

- Studies show that lower NAD in cancer patients shows a slowing of the tumor (in mice).

- NAD boosters can increase cancerous growth for mice that already have cancers, or so it seems.

- Not a lot of strong data around this; consult your physician.

# Resveratrol

- Cert 1 (1/7 sirtuins) is increased by 13x by resveratrol.

- Resveratrol is found in red wine.

  - You would need to drink an absurd amount of red wine to get the necessary amounts of resveratrol.

- You can get resveratrol from plants.

- 250 mg - 2000mg a day.

- You can’t simply swallow it with water.

- It needs to be mixed with food, yogurt, or olive oil.

  - Resveratrol is hydrophobic.

- Resveratrol given to rodents shows:

  - Protected against western diet.

  - Fat mice on resveratrol lived as healthy and long as lean animals.

  - It shows similarity in humans.

- Resveratrol has been shown in humans to:

  - Reduce fasting glucose

  - Increase insulin sensitivity

  - People with 30 BMI were able to lower LDL, urea levels and increase HDL.

- Known as an agent to prevent cancer.

- French Paradox

  - Drinking red wine over 30 years can have an accumulative effect.

## Fisetin and Quercetin

- Sirtuin activators

- Cenalytic - Kill senescent cells (zombie cells that have bad epigenome)

- Fisetin has been shown to increase lifespan in mice by up to 30%

  - By removing senescent cells and activating cert-1 defenses.

- Quercetin

  - Show remarkable results for longevity.

  - Reduces inflammation and liver fat.

- Requires more human studies.

# Rapamycin and Rapalogs

- Inhibit mTOR (mimics fasting).

- They are used for immune suppression.

- Not many studies on humans.

- It has been seen to be effective on non-human organisms.

- Rapamycin mimics adversity.

# Spermidine

- Crystals in sperm are spermidine.

- Extends lifespan in mice and other organisms.

  - Live longer and have other youthful capacities.

- Stimulates autophagy in the mTOR pathway.

- Stabilizes changes in the epigenome (x-differentiation).

- Cognition is improved in older Americans.

- Now it is gotten from wheat germs.

# Metformin

- AMPK activator

- Used in type 2 diabetics.

- OTC in most parts of the world.

- Many theories of how AMPK is activated.

- Perceived adversity impacts a few pathways.

  - Lower energy, activating AMPK

  - Increases NAD levels, activating the sirtuins.

- Mice on metformin were healthier and longer-lived.

- Muscle switching is improved in humans who take metformin.

- Metformin reduces the likelihood in chances of getting other diseases.

- Study to show that aging can be slowed down by metformin.

- People are now taking metformin with the approval of their physicians.

- Metformin has downsized

  - Can cause lactic acisidocis.

  - Lack of hunger, upset stomach.

  - Doesn’t make a big difference in muscle size, (5%). Can lower muscle size, but also decreased inflammation.

## Berberine

- Take it with olive oil or yogurt.

- It works very similarly to metformin.

- Higher doses, 1-2g

- Shown substantial increases of lifespan in mice and fruit flies.

# Dr. Sinclair’s Protocol for Longevity Molecules

- Morning

  - 1 Gram of resveratrol each morning.

    - Yogurt or olive oil.

    - Taken in the morning, you can take it with a fast, just not too much food.

  - 1 Gram of NMN each morning.

    - Based on human studies.

  - .5 a gram of Fisetin and Quercetin in yogurt.

  - 1 Gram Spemidity

    - Recently adopted

  - It is good to take in the morning as it correlates with our circadian rhythm and natural secretion of NAD by the body.

- Night

  - 800 milligram of metformin at night.

    - After dinner.

    - Skips them on the night before an exercise.
