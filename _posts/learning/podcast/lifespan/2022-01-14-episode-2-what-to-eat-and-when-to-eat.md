# When to Eat

- Eat less often for longer life.

- Sertruin gets activated by hermetic effects.

- mTOR - A protein complex in cells that registers amino acids. When you have a lot of protein, you will activate mTOR, which will help you build “things.” It's why eating steaks helps build muscle.

  - Down regulating mTOR will increase longevity.

- AMPK - An enzyme that responds to low energy. When you are hungry, you create more AMPK. It creates mitochondria.

  - When we fast, we create more AMPK.

  - When we create more AMPK, we feel better and fight aging.

  - Metformin creates more AMPK.

- Fasting and drugs which inhibit fasting will increase longevity.

- Benefits of fasting

  - Calorie restrictions activate the natural defense mechanisms of our cells.

  - When we are hungry, our genes that create NAD kick off.

  - Organisms live longer when they have restricted calories.

  - People become insulin sensitive

- Fasting regiments

  - Everyone is unique; measure what is happening with your body to understand what works for you.

    - Insight tracker is an excellent tool for this.

  - Long periods of fasting(3-7 days)

  - Time-restricted feeding

    - At least 16 hours of not eating or not eating much

    - Skip breakfast and have a late lunch.

    - Ideal to eat only one meal.

- Your liver will learn to modulate your liver. After a few weeks, you will feel less hungry because your liver will create glucose.

- Drink lots of fluids to curb hunger.

## What we should eat

- What we shouldn't eat

  - **Eat less sugar!**

    - Glucose shuts off many longevity mechanisms.

  - Super high protein

    - High protein will increase mTOR, which is not suitable for longevity.

    - High protein might make you feel good in the short term but not long term.

- Instead of using mTOR in the short term to repair muscle, we can use it as a “recycling” mechanism called autophagy.

- Fasting and eating the right things not only slows down your aging but reverses your aging.

- Popular diets

  - Okinawan diet

  - Mediterranean diet

  - Pescatarian diet

- Xenohormosis - Eating plants that have experienced stressed

  - Resveratrol - Activate and inhibit pathways in the body to decrease aging

  - Organic, local, and colorful plants

# Takeaways

- Eat less often

  - Less sugar, fewer snacks.

- Less red meat, more veggies

  - Enjoy veggies that have been stressed out.

- End meals with sugar; don’t start with sugar.

- Meditterian is one of the best diets.

- Obesity isn't just an epidemic of making people bigger, it's about people aging faster.

- Put your bodies in states of “wants," this will stress them enough to work harder and fight old age (colder climates, less food).
