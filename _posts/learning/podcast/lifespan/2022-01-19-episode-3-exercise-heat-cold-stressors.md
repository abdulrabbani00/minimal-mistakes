# Introductory Thoughts

- Iron (Fe)

  - Having too much iron can accelerate aging.

  - We need iron for hemoglobin, but the levels don't need to be as high as we thought.

  - People will longer lives tend to have lower iron.

  - High iron can create zombie cells.

- Free Radicals

  - Three types

    - Superoxide

      - Can lead to damaged proteins, which can be ridden due to fasting

    - Superoxide anion

      - Creates most of the oxidative stress within the body

    - Hydrogen peroxide

      - Bad for your body

  - Too much iron will create some of these radicals and prevent the "removal" of others.

  - Measure your iron to understand if you need more or less iron (and the type of iron).

- Diet

  - Eat less often

  - Eat more plants

  - Take a rest from food to turn on your body's protective methods.

# Mimic Biological Adversity

- Survival Circuit

  - 1980 - We didn't know genes could control aging

  - In the 1990s, Cynthia found that worms could live longer based on a gene mutation.

    - The gene was associated with gene mutation.

  - Sirtuins and D2 genes

    - These genes speak to the rest of the cells to live longer.

    - The worms can live longer because these worms were programmed to survive longer.

    - These worms were able to mimic starvation have the benefits of starvation without starving.

- How do genes know that they need to turn on survival mechanisms

  - Sensors

    - mTOR - Sensing levels of amino acids in a cell

      - Lower levels of branch amino acids down-regulate mTOR

    - AMPK - Senses energy

    - Sirtuin - Senses NDA, which goes up with exercise and hunger

  - Cells communicate with each other through insulin

    - Insulin is a signaling protein

  - We've always had to fight off adversity

    - But now our society is based on comfort

    - The body doesn't expend energy to protect itself

    - We need to trick the body to get out of its comfort zone and protect us.

      - Intermittent fasting with adequate nutrition

  - Benefits of adversity

    - Burn fat

    - Increase metabolism

    - More alert

    - Defend your body from infections and internal diseases

- Get off your butt

  - Sitting down is bad for us.

    - Lower testosterone

    - Lower muscle mass, particularly in the hips

  - Stand up, walk, run, cycle

    - Force your body to suck in more oxygen

# Benefits of Exercise

- Exercise isn't just beneficial for fitness and vitality. It can stop diseases

  - It can slow down and prevent 23% of cancers

  - 30% reduction of heart disease

  - At least 50 minutes a week

- Most diseases are an accumulation of symptoms of aging.

- Horvath clock - The biological clock

- Slowing down the biological clock can be done by exercise.

- Try to get 4000 steps, get off your ass.

- Walk after eating

  - It gets your glucose levels to level out.

  - Get your muscles moving, and stimulate the creation of blood vessels.

- Creates a high level of AMPK activity

  - AMPK registers energy in the cell

  - High levels of AMPK → More mitochondria → Long term health benefits

- Low levels of exercise are good, but you need vigorous exercise.

  - Vigorous exercise is needed for hypoxia.

    - Low levels of oxygen are good for you

    - Even 10 minutes a few times a week

  - Hypoxia turns on helpful genes for blood vessel growth and mitochondria.

  - Running damages the cells, but this is good.

- More mitochondria allow you to create more chemical energy

- More blood vessels get more oxygen to tissues.

## Glucose sensitivity

- As we get older, our muscles and brain get less sensitive to the insulin our body puts out.

  - Mainly due to the aging biological clock (x-differentiation)

  - Our body gets worse at taking in glucose, so we don't create enough mitochondria.

  - There is also too much glucose flowing around our body, damaging blood vessels' lining.

- Veg-f

  - Made by muscles after exercise

  - Goes into the lining of blood vessels.

  - Promotes the creation of blood vessels.

  - During aging, the signaling mechanism doesn't work as well.

- Turning on the production of NAD can increase veg-f and help blood flow and the creation of blood vessels.

## Epigenome - Regulator of DNA

- It tells genes whether to be on or off.

- Believe epigenome is responsible for aging.

  - People who have a younger biological clock tend to have lower biological clocks.

- You can measure proteins in the blood to measure aging.

- People who exercise have a younger epigenetic clock.

- These clocks can also predict your death.

  - But you can change that number.

- Taking measurements is essential so you can take the necessary actions for "getting younger."

- Patrick Griffin - Describes a way to pool samples for DNA testing.

  - Hopefully, we will be able to take the Horvath test for less than a dollar.

## Exercise Recommendations

- There isn't the best kind of exercise, do what you love.

- Just get **moving**.

- At least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week. Try to spread it out

  - Low heart rate is a good metric for health.

- Wearables

  - As time moves on, we will get better at measuring our health.

  - Inside tracker is greater for measuring your age.

- Importance of weight training

  - Maintain hormone levels

    - You can be prescribed testosterone

    - Or you can naturally boost it

      - Exercise large muscles, glutes, back, legs

  - Ability to walk well

  - Harder to build muscle as you get older; that's why you need to maintain it.

  - Breaking a hip is close to a death sentence.

  - If you have muscles around your waist, you're less likely to break muscles as you fall.

- Senescent Cells (Zombie Cells)

  - When the epigenome becomes too out of wack, the body shuts the cells down and creates senescent cells.

  - You want fewer senescent cells.

  - You can kill off or reverse the senescent cells by exercise.

## Takeaways on Exercise

- A low level of exercise is needed. Get off your butt.

  - 4000 steps a day at least

- High intensity

  - A few times a week, run out of breath

  - 75 minutes a week.

- Muscle building

  - Hit the weights, maintain the muscle mass

- All of this will make you live longer causes adversity memetics.

# Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)

- Wounds repair faster when you give them more oxygen.

- Hyperbaric chambers - Room with increased pressure, making the oxygen "thicker,” making you breathe more oxygen per breath.

- HBOT can reverse aging

  - Grows back the aglets of chromosomes

  - Improved dementia and Alzheimers in humans

- Improve memory, telomeres, cognitive performance (still early)

- Not sure why it's working, but we know it's working.

  - Similar to hypoxia, maybe

- It impacted senescent cells.

- Great way to mimic exercise

# Cold Therapy

- Being cold creates brown fat

  - Found in babies, which helps them fight the cold.

  - Adults have brown fat, and it mostly exists on your back.

  - Brown fat is very healthy

    - Revs metabolism

    - Burns white fat

  - Brown fat has lots of mitochondria.

- Significant effects of longevity are due to the cold.

- Make brown fat in middle age cause its harder to create brown fat when you're older.

- Treatment

  - Take cold showers

  - Sleep with very few covers

# Applying Heat

- Saunas are great

  - 20% reduction in cardiovascular disease

  - A few times a week

- Helps stimulate new pathways.

- No negative evidence of sauna

- Hot shower

# Adversity Mimetics

- Turning on the defense mechanism produces endorphins

- Basic protocols

  - Cycling heat and cold

  - More is better

  - Cold showers and hot showers both have their benefits.
