# [Overview](https://youtu.be/RUiRFGX1Oqs)

- A lot of this discussion includes things that the FDA does not approve.

- There is a lot of misinformation about specific topics within this conversation.

- Always talk to a doctor before making any changes.

# Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

- After 30-40, we tend to lose 1% testosterone levels.

- Not simply used for sexual dysfunction, but health, fitness, and other things.

- Just because you feel younger doesn’t mean you are reversing your biological aging.

## Survival Mechanisms

- Survival conditions tell our bodies to hunker down; hard times are coming

- Abundance conditions tell our body times are good and to rebuild and reproduce.

  - TRT and growth hormone GH do this.

- Need to have cycles of wants and needs, great long term.

- We need to have cycles of abundance for growth, but this is only good short-term.

## Effects

- Improvements

  - Libido

  - Muscle growth and power

  - Aerobic abilities

- Risk and side effects

  - Worst sleep apnea

  - Higher likelihood that your testosterone turns into estrogen (aromatase).

  - Develop breast tissues

  - Larger prostate

  - Shrinking testosterone

- Supplementing with Testtorone is not synonymous with a long life.

- Just because something is good for you today doesn’t mean it will not benefit you long term.

- Adversity mimetics are good - Lack of food, lots of exercises

- Abundance mimetics - Probably a problem long term.

# Human Growth Hormone (HGH)

- It addresses muscle loss, decreased bone density, increased fat.

  - It might harm long-term health.

- Supplementing with HGH long-term might give you higher chances of cancer and heart disease.

- Bringing HGH levels “back to normal” is good, but getting them too high is not good.

- Negative effects can be

  - One immediate side effect of HGH is sore joints and carpal tunnel.

  - Insulin resistance

  - High blood sugar

  - High cholesterol

- Having a naturally healthy level of testosterone and HGH is very good. But having too much is not.

- Eating at the right time and getting good sleep will help you have the right amount of HGH.

- Working out the larger muscle groups like your legs and back is a great way to increase testosterone naturally.

# Peptide Supplementation

- Peptides are strings of amino acids.

  - They are used by cells to communicate with each other.

- Insulin is one of the most studied peptides.

- We can now synthesize peptides in machines.

  - Some people have these machines at home and treat themselves (not recommended).

- Typically safe

  - Typically small

  - Not foreign to the body

  - Metabolize fairly quickly

- When giving peptides to people for anti-aging, it’s used for its recovery properties.

  - Signatures of adversity mimetic.

- Some peptides can be used for longevity.

- FDA is nervous about the use of peptides at this stage.

  - Getting many peptides in the US is tough.

- Your body can reject these peptides causing arthritis-type effects.

- Most results occur from mice studies. The results are anecdotal.

## MOTS-c

- When injected in mice, it lowers blood sugar and increases mitochondrial activity.

  - Reduces fats in the body.

- Potentially can be used to increase longevity.

# Exosome Therapy

- Exosomes send messages throughout the body. We can collect them and understand the messages we send throughout the body.

  - We can read these messages to understand what is going on in the body.

  - We might also be able to send “false” alarms to create the adversity effect.

- Injecting exosomes in mice has shown that they can live longer.

  - There could be some special message in the exosomes that cause beneficial actions related to aging.

- Specific exosomes can also rejuvenate senescent cells.

  - Instead of killing senescent cells, we can rejuvenate them.

# Stem Cells

- Stem cells are cells that can divide asymmetrically to produce new cells. They tend to stay juvenile.

  - Multipotent - Can make a few different types of tissues (embryo)

  - Pluripotent - Can create any type of cells and tissues.

- Yamanaka was trying to turn adult cells into pluripotent cells

  - Found five genes that can be used to achieve his goal.

  - You can take someone’s cells, reprogram them, and turn them into anything you want.

- The use of domesticated viruses is used to reprogram cells.

- Pluripotent cells can be used to treat various parts of the body.

- Pluripotent cells can cause cancer, so we don’t currently use pluripotent stem cells.

- Most scientists are using autologous stem cells.

  - Remove cells (like fat cells), plurify them, and put them back in the body.

- Stem cells age as well. They can also be kicked out of their niche.

- You can capture your stem cells in your 20-30’s and put them in a bank, then use them when you get older.

- You might want to consider “banking” your child’s cord blood.

- Most stem cells don’t find their niche when injected.

# Cellular Reprogramming

- Instead of adding new stem cells, it might be better to rejuvenate existing stem cells.

- We might be able to rebuild parts of our bodies that are not working well.

- Dr. Sinclair might have found a way to reverse the aging of cells, about 80% reverse.

  - But unlike the Yamanaka effect, it doesn’t cause cancer.

  - Was able to restore eyesight in blind mice.

- By introducing three genes from the Yamanaka effect, they found that they could regrow damaged cells.

  - They mimic glaucoma, and then they can reprogram the eye cells and reverse the aging in the optic nerve.

- We can rejuvenate skin cells, muscles cells, nerve cells, and other cells.

  - It rejuvenates cells.

- Hoping to utilize cellular reprogramming to restore vision in humans within the next two years.

- It was done by leaving the genetic code the same but changing the epigenetic code (the reader's code).

  - Reverses the effects of X-differentiation.

  - But not entirely sure how the X-differentiation is done.

- Imagine a pill where we can reset the age of all our cells in the body.

# Resetting the Aging Clock

- We might do it through genetic reprogramming, exosomes, or other methods.

- A treatment regiment is being tested right now by Dr. Grey Fhey.

  - Using HGH, DHEA, and Metformin, he could mitigate the harmful effects of GH.

  - After a year of this treatment, the age of these men went back 2.5 years.

- HGH can stimulate the thymus, but it can also have many adverse effects. But by negating the effects of HGH, he got a significant impact.

- Measuring the biological age via the Horvath or epigenetic clock is good, but it would be great to see the age of individual cells (tissues, muscles, nerves, etc).
