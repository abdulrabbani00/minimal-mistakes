12. _Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation_ by Lynne Truss

13. _**Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life**_ by Victor Herman

    1.  One of the most powerful and moving books I have ever read. Victor Herman might be the toughest person to have ever lived. We can all find inspiration through him.

1.  _Linux Kernel Development 3rd Edition_ by Robert Love

2.  _Internet Core Protocols: The Definitive Guide: Help for Network Administrators_ by Eric Hall

3.  _**The Richest Man in Babylon**_ by George S. Clason

4.  _The Spook Who Sat by the Door_ by Sam Greenlee

5.  _Just Mercy_ by Bryan Stevenson

## 2021

1.  _Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man_ _on the Planet_ by Jesse Itzler

    1.  When David Goggins dies, he will have to have a conversation with Victor Herman to determine who is the toughest human being to have ever lived.

2.  _Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader_ by Herminia Ibarra

    1.  NA - 06/08/21

3.  [_**The Mastery of Love**_](/categories/learning/book_report/the_mastery_of_love) by Don Miguel Ruiz

    1.  05/26/21 - 09/30/21

4.  _The Art of War_ by Sun Tzu

    1.  NA - 10/06/21

5.  [_**Can't Hurt Me**_](/categories/learning/book_report/cant_hurt_me) by David Goggins

    1.  10/06/21 - 10/17/21

6.  _Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage_ by Alfred Lansing

    1.  10/18/21 - 10/27/21

    2.  A phenomenal story that seems almost unreal. I listened to the audiobook, and I was taken away. The story requires some time to build up, but halfway through, you can truly see, feel and emphasize what the sailors are experiencing. It has moments that will make your stomach turn and make you yell at God for his cruelty. It also has moments of satisfaction where youâ€™re laughing and giggling. Overall, this is truly an extraordinary book that I would highly recommend.

7.  _The Outsider_ by S. E. Hinton

    1.  NA - 10/31/2021

8.  [_12 Rules for Life_](/categories/learning/book_report/12_rules_for_life) by Jordan Peterson

    1.  01/19/21 - 11/03/21

9.  _An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything_ by Chris Hadfield

10. _Oedipus_ the King by Sophocles

    1. 11/04/21 - 11/15/21

11. _The President and the Freedom Fighter_ by Brian Kilmeade

    1. A moving book about the life and work of Abraham Lincoln and Fredrick Douglas. Two unlikely friends in a critical time of American History. An accurate account of the two men does not glorify them but instead truthfully outlines their actions, feelings, and views at various points in their lives. I was honestly more touched and moved by the life of Fredrick Douglas, a man who was born a slave, yet died a legend.

    2. 11/10/21 - 11/23/21
