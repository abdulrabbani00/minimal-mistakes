# Overview

My girlfriend, who was teaching 6th grade at the time had put together a sci-fi creative writing assignment together for the kids, I thought I would take a stab at it. I hope you all enjoy it. Below is the prompt that I chose:

## The Prompt

Using first-person point of view, write a short story where intelligent robots have rebelled against humans and are trying to take over Earth. You could write from the perspective of a robot or a human.

- Use a first-person point of view and a character’s perspective
- Describe setting & include image of setting
- Include at least 2 sci-fi elements
- Explain what you see, how you feel, what you think of the world...

# The Response

I finally have a moment to catch my breath, my heart is racing faster than those damn gears. But tonight is the last night we run, enough is enough, we bought those gears into this world, and we can surely take them out of it. I don’t remember exactly when it happened, when we stopped paying attention to the gears, when we stopped questioning if they had too much information. I mean everyone did say just accept those cookies, don’t worry the information Google is collecting is only for advertising. Now, look at us, running through the thick forest of Montana, because it’s the last place where the gears haven’t set up their towers and technology, its humanity's last stronghold.

While we were so hypnotized by our smartphones, our smart glasses, our smartwatches, and our smart little gear “friends,” we forgot all about our parks, our nature, our forests, and our desserts. Now, this dewey, lush oasis is our last hope, it's as if life itself, in all shapes and forms is coming together to fight the enemy.

Throughout this fighting, if there’s one thing I learned it's this, while I buried my head into the technology that has enslaved me, I ignored the nature that freed me. While I was so busy trying to “connect” with everyone on social media, I was disconnected from the planet that binds us together.

If we win this war against the gears, we should consider it a lesson. We shouldn’t be clinging to these unnatural gears, we are a part of nature. We should be in touch with our roots, we shouldn’t be apart from nature.
