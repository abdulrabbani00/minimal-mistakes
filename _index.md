I’ve been working on a few exciting things in the last few months. I am working behind the scenes on a potential new idea. Stay tuned for more.

## Professional

A few *professional* updates:

- Messari’s Mainnet event was a huge success. We unveiled many new products, including the new market data pipeline that my team led.
- I have completed a design course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-f8b88c86-d127-402b-b6d3-62c19c3b06b8/). This was an incredibly eye-opening course. I learned about the design decisions made all around us.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- I am very excited about the upcoming college wrestling season. This is my favorite time of the year as a sports fan.
