# Updates

Last updated:01/01/2025

Happy New Year, everyone. I hope everyone enjoys time with their friends and family. I spent some time [reflecting on 2024](/categories/mastery/reflecting-on-2024) and I'm excited for 2025.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- I am going to slow down on my business endeavors. I want to focus on my job and my family. I will still work on my business ideas, but I will not be as active as I have been in the past.

- Crypto is having a moment in the mainstream, and I'm very happy about it. It's been tough in the trenches over the last few years. If you're looking to learn more, check out my [starter guide](categories/cryptocurrency_and_the_blockchain/crypto-starter-guide). It's a bit dated but has some interesting resources.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- College wrestling just started, and I am really excited for another season.

- I just finished God Of War (2018) and I loved it. It was an epic game it took me back to my childhood.

- I am finally good at Snowboarding. My wife and I took a trip to the Catskills and I was able to shred.
