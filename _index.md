# Updates

Last updated:08/23/2024

It's been almost a year since my last update, a lot has happened since then.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- I've been building a social platform called [Civikka](https://civikka.com). I want to make a difference in the way our democracy works, here's my first try.
- Frontend development isn't all that bad, I really enjoy using Sveltekit, it's changed FE development for me.
- I've been using Obsidian for journaling and personal life tracking, I can't recommend it enough.
- I dislocated my shoulder Wrestling, I am no spring chicken. I've recovered sufficiently and will be back in the Gym soon.
## Personal

A few personal updates:

- I just got back from three weeks in Spain. It was wonderful, I went to Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, and Sevilla. Europe is old. The lifestyle and value system is very different, although its too lax for me, I respect it.
- For those of you who don't know, I got married to my high school sweet heart in February.
