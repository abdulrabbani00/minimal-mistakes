Last updated: 11/13/2022

I’ve been spending a lot of my free time and investing it in my personal development. Whether it be adding new skills to my tool belt or considering entrepreneurial ventures, I am focused on planting the seeds for my future successes and endeavors.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- [**Mentorship Program**](/categories/career/mentorship_program) - I've started a **free** mentorship program to help people start or further develop their careers in tech. If you know anyone interested, please give them my contact information.

- [**Web Summit**](/categories/learning/conferences/web-summit-2022) **-** I had the pleasure of going to Lisbon and attending Web Summit.

- **Continuing in My Learning Experience -** I have been taking an ML course over the last few months. It’s a natural progression for myself and my career. As someone who has worked as a backend developer, data engineer, and DevOps engineer, I look forward to adding a new tool to my belt.

  - Please let me know if you have any exciting problems worth considering in the ML! I would love to tinker around and put my newfound knowledge to the test.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- **College Wrestling -** It is finally that time of year; college wrestling is upon us. If anyone else is a fan, please feel free to reach out! I would love to chat about the events weekly.
