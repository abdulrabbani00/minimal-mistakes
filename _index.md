Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. I hope everyone enjoys time with their friends and family. I will be spending time in the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- I've been building a social platform called [Civikka](https://civikka.com). I want to make a difference in how our democracy works; here's my first try.
- Crypto is having a moment in the mainstream, and I'm very happy about it. It's been tough in the trenches over the last few years. If you're looking to learn more, check out my [starter guide](categories/cryptocurrency_and_the_blockchain/crypto-starter-guide). It's a bit dated but has some interesting resources.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- College wrestling just started, and I am really excited for another season.
- I've built my own PC, and it's fun running Linux again, but sometimes it's annoying.
