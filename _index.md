# Updates

Last updated:11/11/2024

Election season is over, it was an entertaning one but I think we can all agree it's great that it's over.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- I've been building a social platform called [Civikka](https://civikka.com). I want to make a difference in the way our democracy works, here's my first try.
- Frontend development isn't all that bad, I really enjoy using Sveltekit, it's changed FE development for me.
- I've been using Obsidian for journaling and personal life tracking, I can't recommend it enough.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- College wrestling just started, I am really excited for another season.
- I've built my own PC, it's fun running Linux again, but sometimes annoying.
